\chapter{Introduction}
Streaming video reliably isn't an easy job. There are a couple of aspects that
can cause some problems. A significant problem is that there are different video
streaming protocols and not all of them are supported equally by all browsers.
This means a good video host should have its videos in a lot of different
formats to make sure they can be viewed in every browser. The video streaming
protocols have one thing in common, they all stream little video sections
instead of the whole file, because you can do that easiliy with
HTTP\autocite{http}. All this means that at some point the original video file
should be cut in smaller sections and those should be converted to the formats
that are needed.


\section{Traditional setups}
The most obvious setup is ofcourse generating these files once and then setting
up a file server that serves all these little files. This works but takes up
quite a bit of space since you're essentially storing the same video multiple
times. This issue can be solved by storing the raw video and converting it on
the fly to the format needed when a request comes in. This is what the Unified
Streaming software does.

However, in large streaming setups this is not enough for two reasons. The first
one is that the storage server might be far away from the viewer, which means
more time waiting before watching a video. The second one is that the storage
server can be easily overwhelmed with requests, because its just one server. A
simple solution to these problems is using a Content Distribution
Network\autocite{cdns} with reverse proxy caching\autocite{revproxy} nodes.
Those nodes forward the request to the storage server and cache the response. If
another request comes for the same content a node will just respond with the
response in its cache. This works quite good, since a small percentage of the
videos account for a large percentage of the views.
% For live streaming this also works fantastic since it's not even a whole
% video that is downloaded a lot, it is only the last part of that video.

The big problem of this setup is that, just like with the very first setup, it
stores the converted files instead of the raw files, only now in the cache
instead of the storage server. This has two downsides in this case. Again, the
server will contain the same content multiple times, only in this case the cache
server. The other downside, specific to this setup, is that the cache will also
request basically the same content from the storage. Those requests mean more
internal traffic and more waiting time for the viewer.

\section{Proposed setup}
The proposed improvement to this setup is the use of ``Late transmuxing''.
Instead of requesting the converted segments from the storage server, the cache
requests the raw content needed to create a segment. That raw content is then
cached and it can be used to generate responses for all the different formats.

\subsection{Theoretical improvements over the traditional setup}
In theory this has a couple of advantages over the traditional setup. The first
time a specific segment is request it should perform the same, but once that has
happened the same segment can be requested in another format and no network
traffic is generated. This is an advantage in itself, since network traffic can
be expensive at a large scale. However, it also means that there is no extra
latency caused by a request to the storage server and that latency can be
significant. Especially if the storage and the cache server are far located far
away from eachother geographically.

Another theoretical improvement is lowering the storage required on the cache
server to cache a segment. Instead of storing the same segment multiple times it
is now only stored in the raw format. This means that the cache gets filled up
less easily, which means it can cache more different segments.

\chapter{Background}
\section{Different streaming protocols}
At the moment there are four different streaming protocols in widespread use,
DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) \autocite{dash}, ISS Smooth
Streaming \autocite{smooth}, HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) \autocite{hls} and HDS
(HTTP Dynamic Streaming) \autocite{hds}.

\section{HTTP Range Requests}
Range requests have been added to HTTP to serve parts of a file and not full
files.~\autocite{rangerequests}
\section{Caching}
\subsection{Caching range requests}
To cache range requests of any size, ranger \autocite{ranger} can be used.



\chapter{Implementation}
The server setup used consists of two servers, in this case virtual machines.
One that has the video files on disk, this will be called the storage server,
and one that serves as a reverse proxy, this will be called the proxy server.
These servers contain a couple of different server application configurations.
A common characteristic in all these configurations is that the client connects
with the proxy server and that server will then request content the content it
needs to fulfill this request from the storage server.


\section{The CDN setup}
A setup that is currently in use is the CDN setup. In this setup the storage has
some special code running that...
